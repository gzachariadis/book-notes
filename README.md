## Reading Tips

- Commit to one subject for a month.
- Set a maximum length per page of notes. (you are more inclined to revisit a two-three page document than a 20 page one.)
- Re-read good books.
- Underline at the end of paragraph, not as you read.
- Always have a book handy by you.
- Ask yourself what would I want to know about [this book] if I came back to it in a few years?
- "People ask me, how I can remember everything I say, the reason is that I thought them through."
- For most skills, you shouldn't focus on memorization or quotes, but rather concepts and procedures —— Things you can understand and things you can practice.
- Cut 10-15 minutes of study time and expand on your notes. Give them depth. Write about it. Add detail.
- Don't highlight fact because they are important if you already know them, or believe you will remember them without help.
- Don't combine reading with any other activity like listening to music, eating.
- Force yourself to write small sentences.
- Decide on everything if it's a fact or a concept, concepts should be understood and practiced, facts are irrelevant to action but prove a concept and help you rate how good of a job it does.
